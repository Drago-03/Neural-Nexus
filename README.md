   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory using the `.env.local.example` as a template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```
   Then edit the file to add your actual credentials.

4. **Supabase Setup (Main Database & Auth)**:
   
   a. Create a Supabase project at [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (free tier available)
   
   b. Get your API credentials:
      - Go to Project Settings > API
      - Copy the URL, public anon key, and service role key
      - Add them to your `.env.local` file
   
   c. Initialize the database:
      - After setting up your project and environment variables, run:
      ```bash
      # Start your Next.js dev server
      npm run dev
      
      # In a new terminal, initialize the database (one-time setup)
      curl "http://localhost:3000/api/supabase-setup?setup_key=YOUR_SETUP_KEY_FROM_ENV"
      ```
      
   d. Enable authentication providers:
      - Go to Authentication > Providers
      - Enable Email, Google, GitHub, etc. as needed
      - Configure OAuth credentials for third-party providers
      - **For GitHub OAuth**: 
        - Go to your GitHub account > Settings > Developer settings > OAuth Apps > New OAuth App
        - Set the callback URL to exactly: `https://[YOUR-PROJECT-REF].supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
        - Copy the Client ID and Client Secret to Supabase GitHub provider settings
        - It's critical that the callback URL matches exactly what Supabase expects
      - **For Google OAuth**:
        - Set the callback URL to exactly: `https://[YOUR-PROJECT-REF].supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

The application uses the following Supabase tables:

### **user_profiles**
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  first_name TEXT,
  last_name TEXT,
  display_name TEXT,
  email TEXT,
  bio TEXT,
  avatar_url TEXT,
  website TEXT,
  social_links JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### **models**
```sql
CREATE TABLE models (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  price DECIMAL(10, 2) DEFAULT 0,
  category TEXT,
  tags TEXT[],
  file_url TEXT,
  file_path TEXT,
  file_size BIGINT,
  file_type TEXT,
  thumbnail_url TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  downloads INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  rating DECIMAL(3, 2) DEFAULT 0,
  is_public BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'active'
);
```

## Deployment on Vercel

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and create a new project
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Set all the environment variables from your `.env.local` file in the Vercel dashboard
5. Deploy your application

### **Setting Up Environment Variables on Vercel**
- Go to your project settings in Vercel
- Navigate to Environment Variables
- Add all the variables from your `.env.local` file
- Make sure to set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=production`
- Redeploy your application to apply the changes

## Monitoring and Analytics

Both Supabase and Firebase provide tools to monitor your application:

1. **Supabase Dashboard**: Track database usage, API calls, and authentication
2. **Firebase Analytics** (if using): Track user engagement and app usage
3. **Vercel Analytics**: Monitor page performance and user metrics

## Edge Functions vs. Serverless Functions

This app uses both Edge Functions (for lightweight operations) and standard serverless functions (for heavier processing):

- **Edge Functions**: Fast, lightweight API routes that run globally close to users
- **Serverless Functions**: More powerful Node.js environments for database operations and complex processing

## Web3 Wallet Integration

Neural Nexus includes a lightweight wallet connection system through the `SimpleCryptoProvider`. This replaces the previous TonConnect implementation.

### **Enabling the Wallet Connection**

To enable wallet connection in your application:

1. Set the feature flag in your `.env.local` file:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SIMPLE_CRYPTO=true
```

2. The wallet connect button will automatically appear in the navbar when the feature flag is enabled.

3. For custom integration, you can use the `SimpleCryptoButton` component:
```tsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

// Import with dynamic to avoid SSR issues
const SimpleCryptoButton = dynamic(
  () => import('@/components/SimpleCryptoButton'),
  { ssr: false }
);

// Then use it in your component
function MyComponent() {
  return <SimpleCryptoButton />;
}
```

4. For direct access to wallet state, use the `useSimpleCrypto` hook:
```tsx
import { useSimpleCrypto } from '@/providers/SimpleCryptoProvider';

function MyComponent() {
  const { activeWallet, connectWallet, disconnectWallet } = useSimpleCrypto();
  
  return (
    <div>
      {activeWallet ? (
        <div>Connected to: {activeWallet}</div>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={() => connectWallet('MetaMask')}>Connect</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Build Instructions

When building the project for production, you might encounter "document is not defined" errors for authentication pages. This is a common issue with Next.js when client-side features are used during static site generation.

To solve this issue, use our custom build and start scripts:

```bash
# Step 1: Use our custom build script that patches the auth pages
npm run custom-build

# Step 2: Start the application using our custom server
npm run custom-start
```

Our custom build script (`build-with-cleanup.sh`) handles the following:
1. Cleans up previous build artifacts
2. Runs the Next.js build process
3. If auth page errors occur, it patches the build by:
   - Creating fallback static HTML files for problematic routes
   - Copying these files to the appropriate output directories

The custom server (`dev-server.js`) then:
1. Serves the static HTML fallbacks for auth routes
2. Handles all other requests normally through Next.js

This approach ensures that authentication pages work correctly in production without the "document is not defined" errors.

## Build Instructions for Auth Pages

Next.js has challenges with client-side authentication pages during static site generation, often resulting in "document is not defined" errors. This project includes special handling to resolve these issues:

### Using the Custom Build Process

```bash
# Run the custom build script that handles auth page issues
npm run custom-build
```

This script:
1. Cleans previous build artifacts
2. Creates static HTML fallbacks for auth pages if needed
3. Runs the build with proper environment variables
4. Patches the generated files to ensure auth pages work correctly

### Using the Custom Server

After building the project, start it with:

```bash
# Start the custom server that handles auth pages
npm run custom-start
```

This custom server serves static HTML fallbacks for authentication pages, preventing issues with client-side code during the initial page load.

### How It Works

The solution uses multiple techniques:
- Middleware detection for build vs. runtime environments
- Static HTML fallbacks for auth pages
- Custom server for serving static content
- Next.js configuration to properly handle client-only pages

If you modify auth-related pages, ensure the build process is aware of these pages by updating the configuration in:
- `middleware.ts`
- `next.config.js`
- `build-with-cleanup.sh`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Drago-03/neural-nexus.git
cd neural-nexus

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your credentials

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Build Instructions

When building the project for production, you might encounter "document is not defined" errors for authentication pages. This is a common issue with Next.js when client-side features are used during static site generation.

For the best production build experience, use our custom build scripts:

```bash
# Standard build with patching
npm run build

# OR for a more thorough approach with cleanup
npm run custom-build
```

The build process includes:
1. Pre-build preparation of static HTML fallbacks
2. The main Next.js build
3. Post-build patching to ensure all files are present

### Running in Production

```bash
# Standard Next.js server
npm run start

# Custom server with enhanced handling of auth pages
npm run custom-start
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "document is not defined" Errors
These errors occur during server-side rendering of pages that use client-side browser objects. Our build process automatically handles this by:
1. Using static HTML fallbacks for auth pages
2. Patching build artifacts post-build
3. Setting proper runtime configurations

### Edge Runtime Configuration
We use the experimental edge runtime for authentication pages. If you encounter issues:
```bash
# Check that your next.config.js has the correct settings
# Ensure each auth page exports the runtime configuration
export const runtime = "experimental-edge";
```

### Missing Build Artifacts
If your deployment is missing critical files:
```bash
# Run the patch script manually
node ./scripts/patch-build.js
```
